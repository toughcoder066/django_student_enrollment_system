                residency [on-campus, off-campus], 
                Status [Regular, Foreign, Fee Paying, Distance]
            
            -	Form(s) for the update of Users (students)
            
            -	Class management (create, update etc)

            -	Course management (create, update etc) 
                Fields: 
                Course Name, 
                Start Date, 
                Duration, 
                Registered Students

    •	Ensure cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness for optimal user experience.</li>
    •	Validate your input.
    •	Generate one report (a list of students who have registered for a course, exportable to pdf.)</li>

b.	Backend Development (use any backend framework or technology):
    •	Create APIs for the above functionalities with validations.
    •	Develop server-side logic, or backend technologies to handle user requests and interactions.
    •	Implement secure API endpoints for user registration, course catalog, student enrollment, and other application features.
    •	Integration with an SMS API to send alerts to students would be advantageous but not required.
    •	Ensure seamless integration between the frontend, backend, and external services should you employ any.
    •	Implement security measures that meet international standards.
    •	Validate the backend data

c.	Database Management (use any structured SQL database):
    •	Create a database for the above functionality. 
    •	Relationships should be enforced.
    •	Design and implement the database schema to store the data.
    •	Handle data validation and ensure data integrity throughout the application.

Note: 
    1.	Put in your best effort to make your application look professional and at the same time aesthetically appealing. 
    2.	You will present the finished app and the code same time you were given for the initial interview today, on Friday 4th August 2023.
